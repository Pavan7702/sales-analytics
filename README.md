# Sales Analytics System Using Java Stream API 📊

This project demonstrates a complete data processing pipeline using Java 8 Stream API. It analyzes sales records with advanced aggregations, filtering, grouping, and transformation techniques.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Basic Aggregations
- Total sales amount
- Average sale amount
- Highest sale record

### 2. Filtering and Grouping
- Sales grouped by category
- Count of sales by region
- Sales grouped by month

### 3. Complex Analytics
- Top-performing products by total sales
- Underperforming regions below a threshold
- Nested grouping: Region → Category → Total Sales

### 4. Advanced Transformations
- Monthly summary reports with total, average, top product
- Salesperson statistics: total, average, max sale, best month

### 5. Real-time Filtering
- Flexible filtering using predicates (e.g., by region, date range, amount)

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Java 8+
- Stream API
- Functional interfaces (Predicate, Function)
- Collectors (groupingBy, partitioningBy, mapping, reducing)

## 📦 How to Run
You can run this project using any Java IDE or online compiler like [Programiz Online Java Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/).

## 📁 Sample Data
Includes realistic sales records with fields:
- Product
- Category
- Region
- Amount
- Date
- Salesperson

## 📈 Output Examples
- Total Sales: ₹245000.0
- Top Products: Laptop, Phone
- Underperforming Regions: East, West

## 📚 Learning Highlights
- Stream-based data pipelines
- Custom collectors
- Thread safety in parallel streams
- Comparison with traditional loop-based approaches
